tiers
1.0 is the best player
10.0 is the worst player

tier 1 - 1.0 to 1.7 is the best players - must have 1 in every team
tier 2 - 2.2 to 2.6 is a little worse then the first tier
tier 3 - 3.0 to 3.9
tier 4 - 4.4 to 5.6
tier 5 - 6.2 to 7.0
tier 6 - 7.2 to 7.4
tier 7 - 8.0 to 9.0
tier 8 - 9.0 to 10.0 - no way team will have 2 from this tier or 1 from 7 and 1 from 8
