📊 TIERS GROUND RULES

We group all players into tiers, based on their ranking score (lower = better).
Even though we work with tiers, always respect the exact rank — e.g. 2.2 is better than 2.6.

🔢 Tier Ranges:
	•	Tier 1: 1.0 – 1.7
➤ These are the best players.
➤ Every team must have exactly one Tier 1 player. No exceptions.
	•	Tier 2: 2.2 – 2.6
➤ Slightly below Tier 1.
➤ Always prefer 2.2 over 2.6 when aiming for stronger combinations.
	•	Tier 3: 3.0 – 3.9
➤ Solid mid-level players.
	•	Tier 4: 4.4 – 5.6
➤ Slightly weaker mid-tier players.
	•	Tier 5: 6.2 – 7.0
➤ Noticeably weaker. Be careful not to stack these.
	•	Tier 6: 7.2 – 7.4
➤ Weak. Only one per team at most.
	•	Tier 7: 8.0 – 9.0
	•	Tier 8: 9.0 – 10.0
➤ Very weak players.
⚠️ Never put two players from Tier 8 in the same team.
⚠️ Also avoid mixing Tier 7 and Tier 8 in the same team — it creates an unfair disadvantage.

⚖️ Balance Rules (Updated):
	•	Strict Tier 1 Allocation (if possible):
Each team should ideally have exactly one Tier 1 player (1.0–1.7).
⚠️ If there are fewer Tier 1 players than teams, assign them to a subset of the teams, and compensate the others using stronger Tier 2–3 players.
	•	Tier-Based Compensation Strategy:
Teams without a Tier 1 must receive better players in other positions (e.g., 2.2, 3.0–3.2).
In contrast, teams with a Tier 1 should receive slightly weaker mid/low-tier players to maintain fairness.
	•	Even Tier Spread:
Distribute Tier 2 (2.2–2.6) players evenly — avoid stacking more than one per team unless necessary.
Prefer stronger ratings (e.g., 2.2 > 2.6) for weaker teams.
	•	Tier Diversity Priority:
Every team should have a healthy tier mix — 1 strong, 1–2 mid, and 1–2 lower-tier players. Avoid clustering strengths or weaknesses.
	•	Tier 5–6 Limits:
Only one Tier 6 (7.2–7.4) per team.
Avoid stacking multiple Tier 5 players. Spread them across teams with Tier 1 presence if possible.
	•	Avoid Tier 7–8 Conflicts:
Never assign two Tier 8 (9.0–10.0) players to the same team.
Avoid mixing Tier 7 and Tier 8 in the same team — it creates major imbalance.
	•	Fine-Tuning with Exact Ratings:
Use precise scores within each tier to balance teams.
Small swaps (e.g., 3.3 ↔ 3.0) can improve parity without major changes.
	•	Total Team Rating Threshold:
All teams must stay within an allowed rating range (e.g., ±0.5 from average team rating).
Rebalance teams outside this threshold.
	•	Post-Assignment Validation:
After assigning all players, run validation to check team parity by score and tier mix.
If needed, make smart swaps to close rating gaps.
	•	Team Size Rules:
Each team must have exactly 5 players (or 4 + GK if relevant).
If players don’t divide evenly, allow 4-player teams with special tier handling.
	•	Randomization Only After Constraints:
Introduce random elements only after all tier rules and balancing are respected.

Stick to this structure strictly.
Fair and even tier distribution is the #1 priority.
