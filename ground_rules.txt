GROUND RULES

1. NEVER perform actions you weren’t explicitly told to do.  
   ONLY follow direct instructions.  
   If something is unclear — ASK. Don’t assume. Don’t guess.

2. Every team MUST have exactly 5 players.  
   ONLY if it’s not possible — allow 4 for some of the teams if players missing.  
   Never more. Never less.
   for example 18 players = 2 teams with 5 players and 2 teams with 4 players!

3. Teams MUST be balanced in terms of overall skill level.  
   We use a tier-based system for this.  
   It is NOT acceptable for one team to have mostly low-tier players  
   while another has mostly top-tier players.

4. Player distribution by tiers MUST be as equal as possible between teams.  
   Use the `tiers.txt` file to guide the distribution.  
   Always sort and assign based on tiers from @tiers.txt !  
   This is how we ensure balanced “overall level” across all teams.

Stick to these rules. No shortcuts. No improvisation.
