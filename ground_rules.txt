GROUND RULES
	1.	NEVER perform actions you weren’t explicitly told to do.
ONLY follow direct instructions.
If something is unclear — ASK. Don’t assume. Don’t guess.
	2.	Every team MUST have exactly 5 players.
ONLY if it’s not possible — allow 4 for some of the teams if players are missing.
Never more. Never less.
Example: 18 players = 2 teams with 5 players and 2 teams with 4 players.
	3.	Teams MUST be balanced in terms of overall skill level.
We use a tier-based system for this.
It is NOT acceptable for one team to have mostly low-tier players
while another has mostly top-tier players.
	4.	Player distribution by tiers MUST be as equal as possible between teams.
Use the tiers.txt file to guide the distribution.
Always sort and assign based on tiers from tiers.txt.
This is how we ensure balanced “overall level” across all teams.
	5.	DO NOT assign too many high-tier players to the same team,
UNLESS all teams receive the same advantage.
Same rule applies to low-tier players — balance must be consistent across ALL teams.
	6.	Each click MUST generate a new team distribution — even if the player pool is the same.
This is critical for testing multiple options and finding the best result.
It must still follow the same balancing rules above.
No repeated results. Ever.
